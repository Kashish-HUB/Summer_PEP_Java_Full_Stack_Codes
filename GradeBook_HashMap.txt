/*Create a java program that uses a HashMap to manage a student gradebook. The program should store student names(String) as keys and their corresponding grades(Integer) as values. Implement the following functionalities:
1.Add anew Student and their grade.
2.Update a student's grade.
3.Display the grade of a specific student,
4. Remove a student from the grade book.
5. Display all students and their grades.
6. Calculate and display the average grade of all students.
